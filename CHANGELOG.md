# Changelog

## 0.0.3 - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added AWS Lambda response streaming adapter support alongside the buffered Lambda adapter.
- Added query retry, retry delay, cancellation, and AbortSignal support.
- Added stable package subpaths for router session/native escape helpers, compat event priority, and reactive runtime state.
- Added development-only opt-in logging for deferred stream errors ignored after abort.

### Changed

- Improved client boundary inference diagnostics and public compiler diagnostic formatting.
- Shared server string/stream emit helpers to keep URL, attribute, and style serialization behavior aligned.
- Expanded static style object optimization with an OXC AST fallback for comments and string literal keys.
- Made router Host header trust policy explicit through `allowedHosts` and `hostPolicy`.
- Updated benchmark results for 2026-05-17 and documented resumability benchmark interpretation.

### Fixed

- Hardened server actions with body-size limits, Origin/Referer validation, and allowlist manifest checks.
- Rejected unsupported compiler `ref={...}` usage with diagnostics instead of silently dropping it.
- Improved stream abort/backpressure behavior and capped computed flush loops.
- Avoided internal package entrypoint dependencies in workspace integrations where stable subpaths are available.

## 0.0.2 - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Improved primitive benchmark performance for mreact list updates, keyed appends, computed scheduling, and selected-row updates.
- Stabilized primitive benchmark reporting by aligning runner defaults and adding gap-from-first-place columns to result tables.
- Split router interaction benchmarks into initial JS/CPU cost, first interaction before network idle, first interaction after network idle, and second interaction latency.
- Clarified benchmark interpretation for resumability-oriented frameworks such as Qwik and Marko.
- Updated README benchmark links and added a GitHub Actions latest benchmark reference.

### Fixed

- Fixed `@reckona/create-mreact-app --help` output so the published CLI exposes expected help behavior.
- Avoided redundant computed queueing and extra row label subscriptions in hot primitive benchmark paths.

### CI

- Switched npm publishing workflow to GitHub Actions trusted publishing with OIDC.
- Kept native platform artifacts in the publish workflow for Linux, macOS, and Windows package publishing.
